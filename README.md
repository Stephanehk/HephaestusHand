# HephaestusHand

The Hephaestus Hand is an patent pending 3D-printed prosthetic arm, designed specifically for people who have been amputated below the arm and above the wrist. Since it is 3D printed, every piece of the hand can be completely customized to the user's needs. Additionally, the Hephaestus Hand is immensely cost-efficient: the average production cost of one Hephaestus Hand is around 300 dollars, while other prosthetics on the market cost upwards of 65,000 dollars to make.

The project has been featured on Fox News, ABC, BBC, and Bold TV.
